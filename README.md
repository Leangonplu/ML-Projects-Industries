As a Data Scientist by background, I present a rigorous selection of notebooks and libraries focused on applied machine learning and data science, covering various industries and sectors. The main objective is to cover a wide range of ML models applicable to identify patterns, trends and key insights to improve prediction accuracy, thus achieving optimal performance and efficiency in data analysis. It should be noted that the code in this repository is mostly developed in Python, predominantly using Jupyter notebooks, unless otherwise specified.

*Help Wanted: If there are contributors willing to help fill out and maintain a Python analysis section in any of the following sectors and industries, please contact me. I can also be contacted to add additional industries. The goal is to work together to create a useful and up-to-date resource for the Python community.*
